Changes for 8.0
- Locked Liberty national value to only be accessible to new_world_nations and fixed the starting immigrant nations to start with it enabled already. (reduces clutter in decision menu)
- Added some extra checks in the individual pop files to prevent non-new_world_nation countries from getting immigrants. (Some spill over was occurring)
- Removed the immigration bonus from the Liberty national value, and instead made it so that nations will only receive immigrants if they have Liberty NV turned on at all. (new_world_nations only ofcourse)
- Liberty national value now gives 25% political reform desire instead of 5%.
- There is now a triggered modifier for when your country has passed there political reforms, that will reduce your political reform desire by 100% and increase your social reform desire by 50%:
	slavery = no_slavery

	press_rights = free_press

- Added 3 decisions to Britain to annex Canada, Australia, or South Africa within the first year of the game if they are AI.
- Total war CBs that traditionally turned on in 1930 have now been put behind a host decision to enable, just like zombies.

- Removed the random american cores causing assimilation issues. (Manhattan commune, New England, Deseret)
- Buffed American Homestead act to now give 50% global immigrant attraction (from 30%) and gave Mexico an alternative Homestead Act that gives 30% global immigrant attraction. The statue of liberty gives 30% for comparison.
- Implemented a new union for the new south andean culture, Peru-Bolivia, and stole HFMs flags for it but I'm using my own decision for it. The quickest way to achieve it is own Lima as Bolivia (or have it puppeted/sphered) or own La Paz (or have it puppeted/sphered) and have 25 prestige.
- Andean has been split into an inaccurate north and south andean to compliment the new Peru-Bolivia change. At the start of the game, GCO has 1.5 million pops / 1.4 million accepted. PBC (peru-bolivia) has 1.45 million / 1.2 million accepted.
- Grand Columbia and Peru-Bolivia both accepted north and south andean.
- Added Peru, Bolivia, and Peru-Bolivia to the options for the Statue of Liberty decision.
- Removed blue borders around host nation.
- Created a new state in Ukraine made out of Chernigov and Poltava so help facilitate easier defense of the Don River. (Both cleaved off of Kiev) Also moved Ekaterinoslav to the state of Cherson for the same reason.

- New Italian formation decision will allow either Sardinia or Two Sicilies to form italy and annex the other based on: Its 1860+ and whoever owns Rome.
- New Prussia to NGF formation concept implementation:
	- At the start of the game, prussia will have a random chance to begin auto annexing its spherelings. The chance of annexation will increase in 1845, 1855, and 1860+ it will be almost automatic. (Use that diplomacy national value!)
	- Once all the spherelings no longer exist or the year is 1870 Prussia may form NGF. (Alsace not required)
	- German formation will be typical, sphere the south germans and own alsace-lorraine.
	- Upon annexation, all former cores of that minor are removed and replaced with Prussian cores.
	- Once NGF forms, all existing german minors + prussia cores are dropped and replaced with NGF.
- Pan nationalist rebels have been removed, including garibaldi redshirts. Italy and Germany must be formed via formation.
- A modifier has been added to China that reduces any researchpoints it may receive from conquest as an unciv to 0. (It will never receive research points from conquest.)
- (Bugfix) Removed some weird ass sea connection between Nagasaki and Cheju.
- Japan Buffs
	- All primary islands in Japan are now "land" connections, meaning they cannot be blockaded.
	- The Hokkaido to Sakhalin to East Manchuria connections are re-established and are now "sea" connections, which can be blockaded.
	- Japan OOB rework, they now start with: 10 transports, 5 frigates, and 3 professional armies that consist of 5 infantry and 5 artillery each.

	- Changed the input(lowered)/output(increased) ratios for synthetic oil factories and fuel factories to actually be profitable and help meet the late game demand.
	- New Factory: Synthetic Rubber Factory, that turns oil into rubber at a profitable ratio.
- Army Unit Changes
	- Lower Airplane damage so that it, after ALL calculations, do 90 damage in the backline compared to specialized artillery doing 80.8 in the backline. (Significantly better balance compared to before)
	- General Tank and Airplane stat balances to make sure they have equal attack and defense, plus I removed a random point of manuever off of planes just in case it causes any issues.
	- Supply consumption rebalance for Planes so that they are the most expensive unit and there won't be this general "cheapness" that has been present since inception.
		- Base Monthly Consumption Prices using all tech and inventions (can be referenced in unit stat sheet)
			- Artillery: 20.955 per unit
			- Tanks: 28.48 per unit
			- Planes: 31.12 per unit (for reference, it used to be 14.)
	- Guards have been removed entirely to allow for a cleaner unit curve into mechanization. (Noted in unit stat sheet as well)

- Persia Rework
	- Complete State and Province rework that reorganizes the pops into far more efficient parcels for national focus efficiency.
	- Each state is at least 400k pop (5 total states at start)
	- Each state has 4, 5, or 6 provinces (helps fit better into warscore balance model)
	- Persia, Makran, Afghanistan, and Kalat are now all known by their wider language group "Aryan" as the new culture.
	- All Central Asians are now classified by their language group "Turkic"
	- Reworked Herat decision to now give cores on Afghanistan, Kalat, and Makran.
	- Added a new decision to Persia to get Turkic accepted, but no new cores. (Ideally new coring system should reward what they can take and hold, but no free revanchism because russia owns it all)
	- Changed RGOs around to make up for the removed provinces. Heavier emphasis on Wool, with a few military resources spotted around.
	- Tabriz will now turn into oil in the late game.

	- Autocracy:

		- Mobilisation Size +2.5%
		- Leadership modifier +100%

- Invention Reworks:
	- Prophylactics and Eugenics no longer give negative pop growth. (gave -0.0002% total together )
	- Xrays no longer gives pop growth to account for the removal of the negatives. (xrays gave 0.0002% total)
- Deleted leftover / unused cultures in cultures.txt (people swear by this reducing lag, we'll see)
- Moved the mobilization button slightly to the left to avoid accidentally clicking it mid war when going to recruit units. It now has a Blue Mobilize button, and once you have clicked it, turns red and says Demobilize. I know you idiots need clear color coding.
- Prussia now starts with the diplomacy national value turned on.
- Starting liferating buff to the western hemisphere has been tuned down from 37 liferating to 35 liferating.

- Statue of Liberty rework:
	- Statue of Liberty decision now gives France an event to choose who in the western hemisphere receives the statue of liberty.
	- Statue of Liberty assimilation rate decreased from 100% to 25%.
- Unit Stats: (updated in Army Unit Stats file)
	- Planes are now balanced equally for attack and defense and won't have that awkward 12% support hanging around.
- Factory Changes:
	All Factories:
		- Maintenance costs have been lowered for cement from 0.5 to 0.25, and lumber has been added for a consumption of 0.25 (about 25% cheaper maintenance costs)
		- All factory construction now requires lumber.
	Fabrics:
		- Cotton factories now require 3 less cotton for input per tier.
		- Wool factories have been rebalance to only require 30 wool instead of 50. (Puts this in line to match profitability of cotton factories.)
		- Industrial Tannery (new building) has been added to provide an alternative source of fabric using cattle, and matching the same base profitability that cotton and wool have.
		- Having all 3 fabric factories in 1 state will buff a regular clothes factory in that state by 45% (15% each)
- Japan Buff
	- Japan now starts with 3 decisions to join UK, USA, or Russias sphere within the first year of the game (1836).
	- Japan now starts with 2 tech reforms, flintlock rifles and bronze artillery. (unlocking regulars and artillery day 1)

	- AI will now only build transports and light ships (beneficial for AI puppets, but the single player AI shits the bed)
- Complete Assimilation rework v2
	- Took me for literally ever, but now assimilation base line rate is the same for all pops and provinces in the game.
	- Rates:
		Increases: Everyday and Luxury good access, equality national value, and new world nation flagged nations in new world continents.
		Decrease: militancy, unemployment, and not meeting Life needs.
	I've put the specific rates but they will literally not make sense, just trust me bro.
	Balance Concept:
		Assimilation rates should never overcome pop growth rates of the minority. So, to understand how assimilation works now, view it as a sort of vampire/parasite that saps the pop growth of minorities to supplement the growing accepted cultures in the state/province.

----------------------------------------------------
Changes 5.0

Changed music files that weren't working to ones that do. (like 70% of them)
Removed the rest of the continental based immigration system and replaced it with the new_world_nation flags. (oversight)
Removed Evasion as a stat from naval combat entirely.
Buffed the RGO size (250%) and base assimilation rate (25%) of africa.
Removed the immigration mallus that was connected to infamy.
Removed the 4% soldier cap to states above 1 million pops. There still exist a limit to chinese states above 2 million that caps at 4%.
Frigates now require a naval base to be built.
Great war capitulation now requires a great war to use on someone. (bugfix)
You are now guaranteed to inherit all substates that are left upon westernization as china.
There is now a base assimilation chance of 1% for europe/asia, 2% for africa/australia, and 3% for north and south america. (Replaces a bugged flag implementation that doesn't work)(bugfix)
Tibet is now cored by china and is considered a substate. This should allow tibet to be inherited upon chinese westernization. This is intended to cleanup the map because in 99% of games, tibet remains a chinese puppet all game.
Eliminated ainu pockets and replaced them with japanesse to help with lag.
Eliminated asian_minor pockets across asia and replaced them with their primary culture in their area to help with lag.
Completed Indian population rework. Pops are now defined by their language group to reduce lag (indo-aryan and dravidian). Doctrine of lapse does work properly with the new cultures.
Late Game Zombie changes - Now requires 60k (instead of 30k) stacks to combat infection/spread and provide containment.
Capitalists will now build factories if there is even 0.1% unemployed craftsmen.
Changed RGO Hire rate for high demand and medium demand so that they will hire pops more quickly.

Returned German liferating to normal puir rates

----------------------------------------------------
Changes 4.0.1

Removed great power tensions event that would cause you to be spammed with a 0.1 infamy or -5 prestige choice. (Was spamming)

Portugal-Brazil now gets Afro-Brazilian accepted.
Redshirts and Italian Pan-Nationalists no longer spawn in Anti-Italy.

Chinese pop nerf has been pulled back from 80% vanilla to 70% vanilla. (30 million total)
Minimum wage reform now lowers life needs requirement for poor strata by 10% for each tier, up to 40% reduction.
African continent has been given cultures that reflect their historical language groups as accurately as I could. Generic domains should inherit these new cultures normally.
Chinese pops have been redone into 2 major groups, north han and south han. The periphery substates have the same pops. (mongol, manchu, etc)
Indian pops have been redone into 4 major culture groups: tamil, avadhi, marathi, and bengali. Bengali is the only non-accepted.
Removed starting PLC, Romania, and Yugoslav cores. (PLC was leftover from a while ago and Yugoslavia + Romania cores all its land upon formation)
Removed the pop loss from Yangtze River flood events until I feel China is in the right population level for its wider game role.
Generic Neutrality has been removed.
Removed French accepted from Belgium.
Removed annoying issue with Empress of India blocking Indian Annexation in 1885 that has plagued us for years. You will now freely inherit with doctrine of lapse without worrying about if you grabbed the empress of india decision or not. Removed ai requirement on India. (Annexation will occur if india is a british puppet in 1885. Period.)
Added a decision available to everyone, with a 10 year cooldown, that turns all non-accepted bureaucrats into artisans in both states and colonies. This solved a rather annoying situation where you are paying non-accepted bureaucrats all game and they contribute nothing.
Fixed Byzantium formation bug. (bugfix)
Assimilation has been completely reworked to be simplified and universal. You can now dependably begin assimilating pops, but it won't be fast. (No assimilation in colonies of course).
National Value Changes:
Order: Buffed starting experience to 30 from 25, added a Leadership bonus modifier which essentially doubles the monthly leadership point gain (good for fishing for good generals)
Autocracy: Buffed mobilization size from 1% to 2.5%
Productivity: Now gives 5% industry tech research bonus instead of commerce.
Equality: Now gives a 500% assimilation rate national focus. (works well in conjunction with Assimilation rework.)
Garibaldi Redshirts can now spawn in Sardinia. Important Italian information for puir base redshirts: (important information for tech inheritance and reforms)
	if redshirts pop in two sicilies and win, sardinia AUTOMATICALLY becomes italy
	if redshirts pop in sardinia and win, two sicilies AUTOMATICALLY becomes italy
	if redshirts pop anywhere else in italy and win, sardinia AUTOMATICALLY becomes italy
	If either power is a great power and the other is not, they will AUTOMATICALLY become italy
Removed all provincial history terrain changes so the map terrain is now accurate entirely with the terrain of the province it is in. (Useless shit in africa and micronesia)
Bugfixed a lot of issues with Anti Italy. It can no longer be released via CB or satellite. (bugfix)
Blocked hussars, cuirassiers, and dragoons + a bunch of factory unlock inventions from uncivs so it doesn't cause a bug upon westernization that forces a rehost.
Turned off player message popups by default.
Fixed Belgian / Dutch treaty of london issues that were causing belgium to crash. (bugfix)
Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo now drops mexican cores as was originally intended. (oversight)

	research_points_modifier = -1.0
	global_immigrant_attract = -4.0
	diplomatic_points_modifier = -1.0
	org_regain = -0.2
    land_organisation = -0.2
    naval_organisation = -0.2

Added another start date with commonwealth powers seperated at the start. (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and South Africa.)

----------------------------------------------------
Changes for 3.0.6

Rework for Italian formation:
	- If either Two Sicilies or Sardinia is a GP, that power is guaranteed to become Italy. If neither party is a Great Power upon formation, the target will be random between them.
	- The power that did not form italy will then be given the decision to become Anti-Italy, and have the same cores as Italy. Once one of the 2 Italian states own all of the peninsula's cores (including sicily but excluding sardinia, venetia, south tirol, and istria) they will be able to wipe all the opponents cores off of Italy.
	- Anti-Italy is literally just Italy but they have cores on one another to restore order / core war.

----------------------------------------------------
Changes for 3.0.5

Added everything to treaty ports CB that was meant to be there originally.

----------------------------------------------------
Changes for 3.0

Japan now starts with 500 clipper goods so they are no longer hostage to the world market at the start.
Colonial migration rework now allows colonial pops who are unemployed to move to other colonies within your control for employment. (Most effectively seen with Indian colonies + Chinese Colonies)
tl;dr Foreign investment is very important now. The base sphere market guarantees from secondaries (50%) and civs (75%) have now been reduced to 0. This means that the % of your foreign investment in your sphereling corresponds to your ratio of their goods you acquire. Sphere guide goes into more detail, but foreign investing in an enemies sphereling and bringing their total % down directly reduces the amount of goods they get from that sphereling into their sphere market by that amount. 
All economic policies can now give and receive foreign investment.
Sphere influence malluses in regards to population have been removed. If you border target country - 50% more influence, your sphere borders target country - 25% more influence, different continent - 25% less influence, and a scaling score ratio mallus / boon based on how low the GP score is relative to the target they are trying to sphere.
Grants have been fixed to allow larger amounts to be transferred.
Added a decision for players that have had a states factory hijacked by non-core pops as the craftsmen. It will convert them out of craftsmen so the earlier you do it the better. The decision has more information in its info box.
Reduced mean time to happen for core integration event from 80 months to 40 months, effectively halving the base amount. It is still sped up by revolution and counter revolution tech + nationalism and imperialism + low militancy. Slowed down by high militancy.
Made Planes functionally artillery instead of cavalry (oversight)
Made Tanks functionally cavalry instead of infantry (oversight)
Horse inventions (hussar, dragoon, cuirassier) are now 100% invention chance.
Machine guns invention is now a 100% invention chance.
Mission to Civilize, Colonial Negotiations, and Indigenous Garrisoning (all the colonial inventions) now have a 100% invention chance IF any other GP has already discovered it.
Changed Latin Monetary Union from -1% import cost (broken) and -5% tarrif efficiency to +5% tax efficiency.
Ethiopia has been deleted as a starting nation and all of its land has been set to 20 liferating so that it is apart of the middle stage african colonization.
Added modified hpm national values (heavily modified) and the ability to change them as any country any 10 years to any of the national values.
Added cross colonial migration hooked directly into unemployment. (Unemployed colonial pops will, rather quickly, migrate to other colonies where they will be employed.) They behave normally in regards to colony to state and colony to emigration.
Doctrine of Lapse now works accordingly for both civilized and uncivilized India, they must still be a british puppet though.
Max warscore from battles is now 25, from 50.
Australia and Canada have had their minorities removed to see if this solves the assimilation soldier bug causing those idiots to have 17% soldiers.
Changed bonus import cost from owning suez and panama (it did nothing) to 5% tax efficiency.
Colonial pops can now migrate to your states if they meet a literacy threshold of atleast 70%, increasing in chance at 80%, 90%, and 100%. (You'll start seeing movement at 70%). Primary and accepted pops in your colonies will NOT be affected by this change.
China Rework:
	China is now playable for multiplayer.
	Until 1865 china cannot build any other CB except humiliate, cut down to size, and reparations.
	Until 1865 only limited wargoals are available on china: treaty port / substate region / reparations / etc you can check for yourself.
	Added a china specific concession CB that costs 400% more warscore for when it is unciv. Once China westernizes, they will be using typical civ CBs.
	China will be nerfed by 80% of its starting pop down to 21 million pops, 17 million of which are accepted, these numbers are excluding the substates which auto annex upon westernization. ( Comparable to Russian pop by 1865 )
	The 3 untouchable Chinese puppets have been integrated into greater china.
	China now accepts Southern Han. Taiping now accepts Manchu and Southern Han. (just in case)
